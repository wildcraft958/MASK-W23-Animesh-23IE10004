<br>Tech experience-- Thinking of my tech experience i know front end part and currently trying to learn C [ but KGP is stopping me as usual :) ] and note currently i have phy sem.
<br>TASK STORY: so yeah talking about this task i received mail on 9th but as i am in SWG and  NSSC i had a busy schedule also i havent studied and attended any classes other than labs and ET  in august so i had to watch lectures initially i was not thinking of doing task a  i  wasnt not able to take out time and mid sem were coming 
but on friday i was going through my mails i saw MASK mail and i had a  flashback <h2>Reiner: "As a warrior no road left but the one that leads to the very end"</h2>
then i thought lets do what you like anime + coding . so i made a decision lets do it . but then i got task from NSSC took my 1 day . now since i havent studied a bit i binged all maths lecture on saturday and at night i started my task and to say i havent slept whole night doing my task right now when i am writing this its 10:33 and no sleep. tomorrow is my exam. But <h1>" I KEEP MOVING FORWARD "</h1>. task was fun i would thank you all for assigning such a nice task . i learnt few new things which was new to me . it was great experience . <h3>I would want a favour if you allow me then after midsems i will like  make frontend of profile page  currently i have just given the link to that 
 as i didnt had much time to work </h3> . LASTLY I WOULD LIKE TO MEET YOU SENSEI..

 ps; after extension of deadline i thought i would be able to work on my task but since NSSC fest is near we had to work everytime from morning to evening in Kalpana Chawla space tech cell. Took out some time in between to work on tasks so added preloader but it destroyed my margin and padding  of initial code i thought i will get time to correct it but didnt got it.
<br>Past Projects: considering full project so i dont have anything to show as i am working on my new laptop and i didnt use git hub that much before.
but i can show you task that i have done after coming to KGP. Task was given by SWG as i applied for tech team so i had to make a login page for jossa using html and css. I have submitted if you want to have a look. Also currently i am working or i would say work on a  WEBD task from KODEIN KGP after mid sem. You can text me if you want to have a look after 2 OCT.
ps , i have worked a bit on KODEIN KGP task its incomplete but please do have a look.
